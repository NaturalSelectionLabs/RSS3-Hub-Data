His family belonged to the untitled landed gentry (ziemiaństwo). In the United States he adopted the stage name \"Count Bozenta\" as a ploy to gain publicity. \"Bozenta\" was easier for an English-speaking audience to pronounce than \"Chłapowski.\"[14]\n\n"},{"title":"American career","body":"On 20 August 1877 Modjeska debuted at the California Theatre in San Francisco in an English version of Ernest Legouvé's Adrienne Lecouvreur. She was seen by theatrical agent Harry J. Sargent who signed her for a tour on the east coast where she made her New York debut.[20][21] She then spent three years abroad (1879–82), mainly in London, attempting to improve her English, before returning to the stage in America.[22] In 1880, she visited the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall and on hearing that the parish church of Ruan Minor was in need of an organ she collaborated with Mr J Forbes-Robertson to put on a performance. Romeo and Juliet was performed on a temporary stage in the vicarage garden and watched by many local people. A resident of Penzance and soon to be, member of parliament for the St Ives constituency, Charles Campbell Ross played the part of Friar Laurence.[23]"}]}},"_nfts":{"differui":{"signature":"0x5517cd9a0d1f3d4b7faf8a76017bbddc431e37a5fb302f92f08962200046b055113ed21a508170b25f255742862bb492262114c72f384edb98a2920b54f20b981c","nft":{"userId":"differui","avatarId":"1465668171298672640","address":"0x15de1beb13d7d38cbc493d3ecbc0c7650e715c22","tokenId":"289"}}},"@backlinks":[{"type":"following","list":"0x66b57885E8E9D84742faBda0cE6E3496055b012d-backlink@following"}]}
